# prettyurl
Small class to transliterate lots of characters and make a safe and pretty URL.

Class includes  majority (if not all) of diactrics (accented characters), cyrillic, hiragana, katakana, arabic, chinese characters. They are replaced by Latin characters or combinations that are representing how they are pronounced, officially romanized or the closest neighbours in terms of how a chartacer is drawn. It also allows to replace whitespace characters with a chacarter of your choosing (hyphen as default).
